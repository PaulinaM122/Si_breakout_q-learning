# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Breakout Game

This project showcases several reinforcement learning algorithms applied to the classic Breakout game. The implemented algorithms include Q-learning, fuzzy logic, SARSA, Monte Carlo, and a neural network-based approach.

## Game Implementation

The breakout game implementation used in this project was sourced from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/). It provides a simple yet effective environment for testing and training reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Q-learning**: The paddle learns to play Pong using the Q-learning algorithm. To test the Q-learning algorithm, run `main.py` or `simple_main.py`.
   
2. **Fuzzy Logic**: The paddle learns through fuzzy logic. To test the fuzzy logic algorithm, run `fuzzy_main.py`.

3. **SARSA**: The paddle learns using the SARSA algorithm. To test the SARSA algorithm, run `sarsa_main.py`.

4. **Monte Carlo**: The paddle learns using the Monte Carlo algorithm. To test the Monte Carlo algorithm, run `monte_carlo_main.py`.

5. **Neural Network**: The paddle learns using a neural network. Note that this model is experimental and may not function perfectly. To test the neural network-based approach, run `deep_main.py`.

## Usage

To test the functionality of each algorithm, execute the corresponding Python file mentioned above. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

```bash
python <filename>.py
```
